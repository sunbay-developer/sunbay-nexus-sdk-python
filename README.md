## Sunbay Nexus Python SDK

Official Python SDK for the Sunbay Nexus payment platform.

This SDK provides a simple and professional way to integrate with Sunbay Nexus
payment platform from Python applications, with full support for all payment operations.

### Features

- **Simple and intuitive API**
- **Thread-safe client with connection pooling**
- **Clear separation between network errors and business errors**
- **Automatic authentication via API key**
- **Configurable timeouts and retries for GET requests**
- **Python 3.7+ support**

### Installation

Once published to PyPI:

```bash
pip install sunbay-nexus-sdk
```

### Supported Python versions

- Officially supported: **Python 3.7 and above**
- Python 2 is **not supported**.

### Quick Start

#### 1. Initialize client

```python
from sunbay_nexus_sdk import NexusClient

# Option 1: pass api_key explicitly
client = NexusClient(api_key="sk_test_xxx")

# Option 2: read api_key from environment variable SUNBAY_API_KEY
# client = NexusClient()
```

The `NexusClient` is thread-safe and can be reused across multiple threads.
Create it once and reuse it in your application.

#### 2. Sale transaction

```python
from sunbay_nexus_sdk import NexusClient, SunbayBusinessError, SunbayNetworkError
from sunbay_nexus_sdk.models.common import SaleAmount
from sunbay_nexus_sdk.models.request import SaleRequest

client = NexusClient(api_key="sk_test_xxx")

amount = SaleAmount(order_amount=100.0, pricing_currency="USD")

request = SaleRequest(
    app_id="app_123456",
    merchant_id="mch_789012",
    reference_order_id="ORDER20231119001",
    transaction_request_id="PAY_REQ_1234567890",
    amount=amount,
    description="Product purchase",
    terminal_sn="T1234567890",
)

try:
    # If we reach here, code == "0" (success), no need to check is_success()
    response = client.sale(request)
    print("Transaction ID:", response.transaction_id)
except SunbayNetworkError as e:
    print("Network Error:", e)
except SunbayBusinessError as e:
    print("API Error:", e.code, "-", e)
```

#### 3. Query transaction

```python
from sunbay_nexus_sdk import NexusClient
from sunbay_nexus_sdk.models.request import QueryRequest

client = NexusClient(api_key="sk_test_xxx")

request = QueryRequest(
    app_id="app_123456",
    merchant_id="mch_789012",
    transaction_id="TXN20231119001",
)

try:
    # If we reach here, code == "0" (success), no need to check is_success()
    response = client.query(request)
    print("Status:", response.transaction_status)
except SunbayBusinessError as e:
    print("API Error:", e.code, "-", e)
except SunbayNetworkError as e:
    print("Network Error:", e)
```

### API Overview

The SDK provides a `NexusClient` with comprehensive payment APIs:

- Transaction APIs:
  - `sale(request: SaleRequest) -> SaleResponse`
  - `auth(request: AuthRequest) -> AuthResponse`
  - `forced_auth(request: ForcedAuthRequest) -> ForcedAuthResponse`
  - `incremental_auth(request: IncrementalAuthRequest) -> IncrementalAuthResponse`
  - `post_auth(request: PostAuthRequest) -> PostAuthResponse`
  - `refund(request: RefundRequest) -> RefundResponse`
  - `void_transaction(request: VoidRequest) -> VoidResponse`
  - `abort(request: AbortRequest) -> AbortResponse`
  - `tip_adjust(request: TipAdjustRequest) -> TipAdjustResponse`
- Query APIs:
  - `query(request: QueryRequest) -> QueryResponse`
- Settlement APIs:
  - `batch_close(request: BatchCloseRequest) -> BatchCloseResponse`

### Exceptions

The SDK differentiates between network-level and business-level errors:

- `SunbayNetworkError`
  - Thrown for network errors, timeouts, or HTTP non-2xx responses.
  - Has a `retryable` flag to indicate whether the request may be retried safely.
- `SunbayBusinessError`
  - Thrown for API business errors (e.g. `code != "0"`) and local parameter validation failures.
  - Contains `code` and `trace_id` fields when available.

Always catch `SunbayNetworkError` before `SunbayBusinessError` if you need to
distinguish between them.

### Configuration

You can configure the client using constructor arguments:

```python
from sunbay_nexus_sdk import NexusClient

client = NexusClient(
    api_key="sk_test_xxx",
    base_url="https://open.sunbay.us",   # default
    connect_timeout=30.0,                # seconds, default 30.0
    read_timeout=60.0,                   # seconds, default 60.0
    max_retries=3,                       # default 3 for GET requests
    max_connections=200,                 # default 200
    # Optional: custom logger instance
    # logger=my_logger,
)
```

In addition, the SDK uses the standard Python `logging` library:

- By default it logs HTTP requests/responses and errors to the logger named `sunbay_nexus_sdk.http`.
- The SDK **does not** configure handlers or logging levels itself — you are free to integrate with any logging stack
  (standard logging, loguru, structlog, etc.) by configuring or adapting a `logging.Logger`.
- For advanced use cases, you can pass a custom logger via the `NexusClient(logger=...)` constructor parameter; this
  logger will be used by the underlying HTTP client for all log output.

### Using enums

For some fields (such as transaction status and card network type), the SDK
provides enums to make the code more self-documenting:

```python
from sunbay_nexus_sdk import TransactionStatus

# In try-catch block, if we reach here, code == "0" (success)
# So we only need to check transaction_status
if response.transaction_status == TransactionStatus.SUCCESS:
    print("Transaction succeeded")
```

### Integration in web frameworks

In web frameworks (such as FastAPI or Django), it is recommended to create a
single `NexusClient` instance at startup and reuse it:

```python
from sunbay_nexus_sdk import NexusClient

client = NexusClient(api_key="sk_live_xxx")

def process_payment(request_data):
    # build SaleRequest here...
    response = client.sale(request_data)
    ...
```
